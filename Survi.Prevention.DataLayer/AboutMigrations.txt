About the migrations!!!

These are two of the ways to correctly run the migration dotnet cli:

Using the Package Manager Console (the easiest way) :
1. Select Survi.Prevention.DataLayer as your Default project.
2. Go to the Survi.Prevention.DataLayer folder.
3. You can now run your command.

These are some of the available command :
* Add-Migration <name> --> Add a new migration on top of the previous one (or add the first one).
* Remove-Migration --> Remove previous migration.
* Drop-Database --> Delete current database (use cautiously!)
* Update-Database <version> --> Update the database to the latest version or create it if it doesn't exist.  The version is optional.

*** Note that Update-Database can be use to revert to a previous version.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using a windows command prompt:
1. Go to the Survi.Prevention.DataLayer's folder.
2. Run your command like this (ex: dotnet ef --startup-project ../Survi.Prevention.Migrations migrations add CreateDatabase)
*** Note quite sure the --startup-project options is necessary.

* Please note that the migrations will use whatever connection string is set in the ManagementContextInitializer.cs file.


To update database to latest version :
* dotnet ef database update
Note that this will create the database if it doesn't already exist.

To generate a script :
* dotnet ef migrations script <from> <to>
Where <from> is the latest migration ran on the database (0 for the very first one) and <to> is the last script to run.
* dotnet ef migrations script v1_0_1 v1_0_4
In this example, we would consider the database to be currently using v1.0.1 and we would want to update it to v1.0.4.
